Academic Integrity & Personal Use License v1.2
Copyright (c) 2025 Jiacheng Guo
All rights reserved.

This is a custom license intended to (1) support personal learning and (2) protect academic integrity.
This is NOT an OSI-approved open-source license.
By accessing, copying, or using any part of this repository (the “Repository”), you agree to the terms below.

Plain Summary (non-binding, for convenience only; see full license for legal terms):
- You may read, clone, build, and run this code for personal, non-graded learning.
- You may make private modifications for your own learning, but you may not share substantial parts.
- You may NOT use this Repository (or derivatives) to complete or assist any graded submission.
- If you violate these terms, your permission ends immediately and the copyright holder may report misuse.

1. Definitions
1.1 “Code” means all source code, scripts, build files, test files, documentation, and other technical content in this Repository.
1.2 “Graded Work” means any coursework, assignment, lab, project, quiz, exam, take-home assessment, or submission
    evaluated for academic credit or ranking (including pass/fail, bonus points, or partial credit), including
    substantially similar coursework at any institution.
1.3 “Substantial Portions” means any material that would reasonably enable another person to complete, imitate, or
    significantly accelerate a Graded Work, including but not limited to:
    (a) any complete file; or
    (b) any complete solution to a lab/task; or
    (c) excerpt(s) that implement core required functionality; or
    (d) any amount that materially overlaps with the original solution’s structure, logic, or key implementation patterns.
1.4 “AI-Assisted Derivative” means any output produced by an AI tool/service that is generated from, based on, indexed by,
    or materially influenced by this Code (including paraphrasing, refactoring, translation, reformatting, embeddings,
    retrieval-augmented generation, or dataset creation).

2. Permission Grant (Allowed Use)
Subject to full compliance with this License, the copyright holder grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable,
revocable permission to:
2.1 View, clone, build, and run the Code for personal, non-graded learning and study purposes.
2.2 Make private copies and private modifications for your own learning, provided you do not share them and do not submit
    them as Graded Work.
2.3 View the Repository for review/evaluation purposes, provided you do not copy or reuse Substantial Portions except as
    expressly permitted by this License.

3. Prohibited Uses (Not Allowed)
You may NOT, under any circumstances:
3.1 Submit this Repository, or any modified/derived version of it, as your own work for any Graded Work.
3.2 Use this Repository as a solution template for Graded Work, including reproducing its structure, logic, or key
    implementation patterns in a way that materially overlaps with the original solution.
3.3 Provide, share, publish, or redistribute Substantial Portions of the Code, publicly or privately, including but not
    limited to posting to other repositories, forums, chat groups, course groups, solution collections, file-sharing
    services, or similar channels, without prior written permission from the copyright holder.
3.4 Use this Code (in whole or in part) as input to any AI tool/service to generate an AI-Assisted Derivative intended for
    Graded Work submission, or to help another person produce or disguise a Graded Work submission.
3.5 Remove or alter copyright notices or this License text.

Notes on forks/mirrors:
- If you fork or mirror this Repository, you must comply with all restrictions above.
- Where the hosting platform allows, keep forks private. A public fork that redistributes Substantial Portions violates this License.

4. Limited Quotation & Attribution (Allowed with Conditions)
You MAY quote small excerpts for discussion, review, or citation, provided that:
4.1 The excerpt is not a Substantial Portion; and
4.2 You give clear attribution exactly as follows:
    “Source: GuoJiacheng0402/riscv-computer-organization-labs (GitHub).”
4.3 You do not present the excerpt in a way that constitutes a complete or near-complete solution to Graded Work.

5. Requests for Additional Permission
If you want to use the Code beyond what is allowed here, you must obtain prior written permission from the copyright holder.

6. Termination
6.1 Any violation of this License automatically terminates all permissions granted herein, effective immediately.

    control, except where retention is required by law.
6.3 Sections 1, 3, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination.

7. Academic Integrity & Remedies
7.1 The copyright holder reserves the right to pursue appropriate remedies for violations of this License.
7.2 In cases of suspected academic misconduct, the copyright holder may report relevant evidence to course staff,
    academic integrity offices, or the appropriate institution authority.
