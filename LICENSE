Academic Integrity & Personal Use License v1.1
Copyright (c) 2025 Jiacheng Guo
All rights reserved.

This is a custom license intended to (1) support personal learning and (2) protect academic integrity.
By accessing, copying, or using any part of this repository (the “Repository”), you agree to the terms below.

1. Definitions
1.1 “Code” means all source code, scripts, build files, test files, and any other technical content in this Repository.
1.2 “Graded Work” means any coursework, assignment, lab, project, quiz, exam, take-home assessment, or any submission
    that is evaluated for academic credit or ranking (including pass/fail, bonus points, or partial credit).
1.3 “Substantial Portions” means any of the following:
    (a) any complete file; or
    (b) any complete solution to a lab/task; or
    (c) any excerpt(s) that, alone or combined, implement the core functionality required to complete a Graded Work; or
    (d) any amount that would reasonably enable another person to complete or significantly accelerate a Graded Work.
1.4 “AI-Assisted Derivative” means any output produced by an AI tool or service that is generated from, based on,
    or materially influenced by this Code (including paraphrasing, refactoring, translation, or reformatting).

2. Permission Grant (Allowed Use)
Subject to full compliance with this License, the copyright holder grants you a limited, non-exclusive,
non-transferable, revocable permission to:
2.1 View, clone, and run the Code for personal, non-graded learning and study purposes.
2.2 Make private copies and private modifications for your own learning, provided you do not share them and do not submit
    them as Graded Work.


3. Prohibited Uses (Not Allowed)
You may NOT, under any circumstances:
3.1 Submit this Repository, or any modified version of it, as your own work for any Graded Work.
3.2 Use this Repository as a solution template for Graded Work, including reproducing its structure, logic, or key
    implementation patterns in a way that materially overlaps with the original solution.
3.3 Provide, share, publish, or redistribute Substantial Portions of the Code, publicly or privately, including but not
    limited to posting to other repositories, forums, chat groups, course groups, “solution collections”, file-sharing
    services, or similar channels, without prior written permission from the copyright holder.
3.4 Use this Code (in whole or in part) as input to any AI tool/service to generate an AI-Assisted Derivative intended
    for Graded Work submission, or to help another person produce or disguise a Graded Work submission.
3.5 Remove or alter copyright notices or this License text.

Notes on forks:
- If you fork or mirror this Repository, you must comply with all restrictions above.
- Where the hosting platform allows, keep forks private. A public fork that effectively redistributes Substantial Portions
  violates this License.

4. Limited Quotation & Attribution (Allowed with Conditions)
You MAY quote small excerpts for discussion, review, or citation, provided that:
4.1 The excerpt is not a Substantial Portion; and
4.2 You give clear attribution exactly as follows:
    “Source: GuoJiacheng0402/riscv-computer-organization-labs (GitHub).”
4.3 You do not present the excerpt in a way that constitutes a complete or near-complete solution to Graded Work.

5. Requests for Additional Permission
If you want to use the Code beyond what is allowed here,
you must obtain prior written permission from the copyright holder.

6. Termination
6.1 Any violation of this License automatically terminates all permissions granted herein, effective immediately.
6.2 Upon termination, you must promptly stop using the Code and delete all copies and derivatives in your possession or
    control, except where retention is required by law.
6.3 Sections 1, 3, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination.

7. Academic Integrity & Remedies
7.1 The copyright holder reserves the right to pursue appropriate remedies for violations of this License.
7.2 In cases of suspected academic misconduct, the copyright holder may report relevant evidence to course staff,
    academic integrity offices, or the appropriate institution authority.

8. Disclaimer of Warranty & Limitation of Liability
THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY,
WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE
OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.
